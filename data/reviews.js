The architecture deep dives were like the most wow moments for me. Mind-blown emoji was the constant mood throughout. Thanks for the awesome workshop Vilva.",

      "Except storybook I have used all the tools before in my projects but I never cared to look into the internals of each tool after learning the internals of these tools the way I think of these tools have changed. I knew what is an AST but never imagined I could build eslint and babel plugins with it, I have used webpack earlier to set up a react app without CRA but when I learned that we could tap into the compiler using its api's and make plugins for our needs it hit me different. This is easily one of the best workshops I have taken it was very dense and value-packed workshop. Waiting for your next workshop :)",

      "I had the pleasure of attending the two-day web tooling workshop led by Vilva, and I must say, it was an incredibly enlightening experience. Throughout the workshop, Vilva effectively demystified the internals behind popular tools such as webpack, eslint, Babel and Storybook. This deep dive into the inner workings of these tools was truly an eye-opener for me, and I now have a much greater appreciation for the power and flexibility they bring to my day-to-day development work. What really stood out to me about this workshop was Vilva's ability to convey complex technical concepts in a way that was easy to understand and engaging. I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how these tools work under the hood.",

Though I was a little worried because the topic being covered was something I had zero work experience with but Vilva started from scratch and covered almost all the topics that you'll need for a production-ready app. I never imagined that I would attend an 8 hours workshop and never during the whole timespan I felt leaving my seat. He explained every concept one by one with detailed examples, it was such an interactive event, he was continuously taking in our questions and was answering them on the go. We were also provided with a curated list of example projects with solutions for every concept that he taught during the event and also live coding which made things clearer. Overall it was an amazing workshop with a lot of learning and would recommend 100%.",
